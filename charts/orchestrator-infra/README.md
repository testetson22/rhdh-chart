![Version: 0.1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.1.0-informational?style=flat-square)
![Type: application](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-application-informational?style=flat-square)

Helm chart to deploy the Orchestrator solution's required infrastructure suite on OpenShift, including OpenShift Serverless Operator and OpenShift Serverless Logic Operator, both required to configure Red Hat Developer Hub to use the Orchestrator.

## Source Code

* <https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-chart>

## Requirements

Kubernetes: `>= 1.25.0-0`

## TL;DR

```console
helm repo add redhat-developer https://redhat-developer.github.io/rhdh-chart

helm install my-orchestrator-infra redhat-developer/orchestrator-infra
```

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Testing a Release

Once an Helm Release has been deployed, you can test it using the [`helm test`](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_test/) command:

```sh
helm test <release_name>
```

This will run a simple Pod in the cluster to check that the required resources have been created.

You can control whether to disable this test pod or you can also customize the image it leverages.
See the `test.enabled` and `test.image` parameters in the [`values.yaml`](./values.yaml) file.

> **Tip**: Disabling the test pod will not prevent the `helm test` command from passing later on. It will simply report that no test suite is available.

Below are a few examples:

<details>

<summary>Disabling the test pod</summary>

```sh
helm install <release_name> <repo> \
  --set test.enabled=false
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Customizing the test pod image</summary>

```sh
helm install <release_name> <repo> \
  --set test.image=<image>
```

</details>

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete a Helm release named `my-orchestrator-infra`:

```console
helm uninstall my-orchestrator-infra
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

### Installing Knative Eventing and Knative Serving CRDs

The orchestrator-infra chart requires several CRDs for Knative Eventing and Knative Serving. These CRDs will be applied prior to installing the chart, ensuring that Knative CRs can be created as part of the chart's deployment process. This approach eliminates the need to wait for the OpenShift Serverless Operator's subscription to install them beforehand.

The KnativeEventing and KnativeServing CRDs are required for this chart to run. These CRDs need to be present under the crds/ directory before running `helm install`.
After installing the openshift-serverless subscription, more Knative CRDs will be installed on the cluster.

The versions of the CRDs present in the chart and the ones in the subscrtiprion must match. In order to verify the correct CRD, use this following command to extract the CRD:

```bash
docker run --rm --entrypoint cat registry.redhat.io/openshift-serverless-1/serverless-operator-bundle:1.35.0 /manifests/operator_v1beta1_knativeeventing_crd.yaml > knative-eventing-crd.yaml

docker run --rm --entrypoint cat registry.redhat.io/openshift-serverless-1/serverless-operator-bundle:1.35.0 /manifests/operator_v1beta1_knativeserving_crd.yaml > knative-serving-crd.yaml
```
